PROGRESSIVELY FIND SMALLEST
O(n^2)
Find the kth smallest:
     - find the smallest, delete it (continue until kth time -- that is kth
     smallest)
>> copy of list c as temp
k is index(?)
while (k > 1) {
      delete smallest element in list;
      }
      return min(tmp)



SORT THEN INDEX
Sort the list, take kth index:
>>     tmp = msort(list c);
     return tmp[k];
>  nlgn+k
(nlgn)


Should I sort my list before I deal with it? If there is much to be done
to the sorted list, then perhaps yes -- but if I have a simple, single instance
of a task that I need the sorted list, it may not be necessary.


THROW INTO PILES
//Es ist linear.
given an unsorted list of ints,
find a certain element that is kth smallest
go through the list in a for loop, judging each element by this:
   if it is smaller than
1. - choose a pivot value (for now, first element)
2. - partition the list
   -> using for loop, go through list so all values less than pivot is in
   one pile, and all values more than pivot is the other
3. - if the pivot is the kth smallest (there are k-1 smaller values), then
   return the pivot,
   but if pivot is not it, then we recursively 'throw' the smaller or bigger
   unsorted halves of the list (depending on whether the pivot is too early
   or too late to be the kth term) and in turn partition the halves using new
   pivots until we find the pivot as the kth smallest

there is
an array with 20 elements, from [0] to [19].
3, 8, 12, 4, 5, 6, 16, 2, 9, 10,...

A(rray), k, L, H
select(Array,find 3rd,O low,9 high):

looking for kth smallest element in the range of [L] to [k] in list A

first time
L=0;
H=A.length-1

1.- select pivot value
2.- swap pivot value with the value in array[H]
3.- Li = L; Hi = H-1
    low index is low and high index is high
4.- while Li<Hi, a loop:
{
    if A[Li} < p
       Li++
    else
       swap A[Li] and A[Hi]
       Hi--;
       }
    when Li and Hi meet, this for loop finishes...
    
    swap A[H] (pivot) with first right side element
    if pivot @ k, we're done
    else,
	either select(A,k,l,pivotindex-1)
	       or
	 select(A,k,pivotindex,H index)


// from low, going over the list, check each element if it is greater than
   the pivot. if it is, then Li++ (simult both a lower-than-pivot counter and
   an index).
   if the element is not greater than pivot, than switch it with high index.
   Hi-- ; high index moves left, leaving the greater-than-pivot element on
   the right side pile
