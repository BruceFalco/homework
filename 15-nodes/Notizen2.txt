hashing
hash tables

we want to store all info Stuy Students in a data structure by index (array)

you want to optimize for:
1. fishing a student based on 4digit id
2. adding a student by 4digit id
3. changing a student (found by 4digit did)

store by array -> 0(1) time
A[Id - k]
k  the ID range for the senior class (i.e. 1000)

HASH HASHING TABLES
we want to store things in a table by index (array)
we have to take a unique id and convert it into a table index to store it
hash functions (h(x)) is a mapping function
it takes a piece of information and converts it into an index in our hash table
ex. 0515 Numbers
    h(x) = x % 10 000
    convert to 4 digit index
