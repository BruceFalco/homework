LINK LIST
-> each element in the list only knows one thing: the identity of the element
after it
-> all these elements form a list through the identity of whoever is after them

Alice -> Joseph -> Mike -> Mariya  -> Dillon

i.e. Alice only knows Joseph is after her; Joseph only knows that Mike is after
him

to redirect or add an element in between a list, you do the following:
e.g. to add David between Mike and Mariya
- tell David that Mariya is after him; this enters David into the list/tree
--> you can tell two people that one person is after each of them
- then tell Mike that David is after HIM; redirected successfully
otherwise, if we just tell Mike that David is after him and to forget Mariya's
identity, mariya is lost from list forever

Alice -> Joseph -> Mike -> David ==>  Mariya  -> Dillon
